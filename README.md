vscode extension for pytest

vscode doesn't integrate well with pyqt.  autocomplete never works.  Compared with pycharm it is day and night. <br />
But pycharm is detrimental to performance. <br />
<br />
Another problem with pycharm is certain feature in pytest don't work.  Like if your assert is in different file or same file but different function, it doesn't highlight the line your error is on.  And custom assert rewrites don't work. <br />
Vscode don't have these problems but it doesn't show output pertaining to your individual test case.
